      "### For Windows Users:\n",
      "1. **Install Python and pip:**\n",
      "   - Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, ensure that you check the box to \"Add Python to PATH\" to make Python and pip accessible from the command line.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify Installation:**\n",
      "   - Open Command Prompt and type:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     python --version\n",
      "     pip --version\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This will display the installed versions of Python and pip if they are correctly installed and set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "### For Users Without `sudo` Access:\n",
      "1. **Using a Package Manager:**\n",
      "   - If you are on a system like MacOS, you might not need `sudo` to install Homebrew (a package manager), which can then be used to install Python and pip.\n",
      "   - Install Homebrew by running the following in your terminal:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Then install Python:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     brew install python\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify Installation:**\n",
      "   - Open your terminal and type:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     python3 --version\n",
      "     pip3 --version\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - These commands check if Python and pip are installed correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please attempt these steps appropriate for your operating system or situation and let me know if you encounter any difficulties along the way. If you manage to install Python and pip successfully, we can continue with installing the required libraries.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Other Data-fetching Solutions:\n",
      "If direct code execution remains problematic, exploring pre-existing financial data platforms that provide relevant data might be a solution:\n",
      "- Financial news websites and investment platforms often have detailed NVIDIA stock performance data that can be manually extracted and analyzed without the need for local script execution.\n",
      "- Consider if APIs provided by such platforms could be accessed from other environments or tools that are already operational within your system.\n",

      "   - Install Homebrew by running the following in your terminal:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Then install Python:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     brew install python\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify Installation:**\n",
      "   - Open your terminal and type:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     python3 --version\n",
      "     pip3 --version\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - These commands check if Python and pip are installed correctly.\n",

Often, especially in restricted environments, options for installing software or executing scripts may be limited. Here are some alternative suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Direct Online Tools or Services\n",
      "If installing and running your Python code is not feasible, consider using any available online Python environments or financial analysis services:\n",
      "- Platforms like Google Colab or Microsoft Azure Notebooks allow you to run Python code directly in the browser without any local setup.\n",
      "- Portable versions of Python, which do not require installation, can sometimes circumvent restrictions but would likely still need executable permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Data-fetching Solutions:\n",
      "If direct code execution remains problematic, exploring pre-existing financial data platforms that provide relevant data might be a solution:\n",
      "- Financial news websites and investment platforms often have detailed NVIDIA stock performance data that can be manually extracted and analyzed without the need for local script execution.\n",
      "- Consider if APIs provided by such platforms could be accessed from other environments or tools that are already operational within your system.\n",

      "- Announcements about strategic partnerships or expansions into new markets can positively affect stock prices.\n",
      "- Regulatory news or legal challenges, conversely, might lead to adverse reactions in the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding Nvidia's stock performance over the last month requires a detailed examination of stock price data, comparative market analysis, and insights into how specific news events have impacted the stock.
