Course notes:
How to use Claude Desktop with MCP

1.terminal
ls
uv init #initialize proj
uv venv
souce .venv/bin/activate #activate venv
uv arxiv mcp #pip/uv dependencies

2.on claude
(1)settings > developer > edit config
(2)in claude_desktop_config.json, add example json:
# make sure to change a real path for server-filesystem

{
    "mcpServers": {
        
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                "."
            ]
        },
        
        "research": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": ["run", "research_server.py"]
        },
        
        "fetch": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
        }
    }
}

(3) in the claude interface, check whether the servers are added as tools

(4) the apps with feature support

How to use remote server connection?

(1)in the terminal: npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
then y to install libraries
(2)then click  https://s172-29-102-208p6274.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai/ 🚀 to get the inspector
(3)on the inspector, choose SSE ; use url https://s172-9-102-208p8001.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai/sse and
inspector proxy address like https://s172-29-102-208p627.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai
then connect
(4)you can inspect the MCP parameters

How to set up local connect?
See in notebook L4 in this folder.

How to use Render to deploy the server? 

On terminal, cd to the mcp folder:
(1)git init 
(2)echo ".venv" > .gitignore
(3)git status
(4)render doesn't support uv, so use pip:
uv pip compile pyproject.toml > requirements.txt
(5)echo "python-3.11.11" > runtime.txt
(6)git status #check the runtime
(7)git add .
(8)git commit -m "ready for deployment"
(9)create a new repo on github and push in an existing repo from the cml
git remote add origin
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git remote -v #check the push
(10)sign up on render.com; choose "Deploy a web service" and add the repo link
THE ONLY THING to change is at "Start Command":
python research_server.py
Then deploy
(11)check the sse link:
remote-research.onrender/sse
if there is a session id, it means pass


Other topics on MCP:
1.Authentications
2.Roots and samplings:
root - a uri that a client suggests a server should operate. for example, a user may say "Only look in these specific folders for the files I need"
sampling - allows a sever to request inference from the LLM they are connected to via MCP, given the user application full control over sucurity, privacy, and cost; a server should talk to LLM to diagnose errors and issues (or even ask for more info from uers)
3.Can different MCPs talk to each other? Can servers to be LLMs?
An orchestritian or manager server?
4.An official MCP registery API
